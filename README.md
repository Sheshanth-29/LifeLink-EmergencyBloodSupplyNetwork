# 🩸 LifeLink - Emergency Blood Supply Network

## 🌍 Overview
**LifeLink** is a web-based platform designed to **bridge the gap between blood donors, hospitals, patients, and blood banks**.  
During medical emergencies, time is everything — and LifeLink helps ensure that every second counts by connecting those who need blood with those who can donate. ❤️  

This project focuses on:
- Donor registration and blood type management  
- Real-time hospital and patient blood requests  
- Blood bank area for maintaining blood stock details  
- Automatic donor reward system (coupon via email upon registration)
